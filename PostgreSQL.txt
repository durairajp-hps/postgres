Here’s a structured 15-day PostgreSQL learning plan with a study schedule of one hour per day. The plan ensures comprehensive coverage of PostgreSQL topics, including basics, advanced concepts, and practical applications. Each week concludes with a 100-mark knowledge test to assess your understanding.

 Day 2: Database and Table Basics
- Topics:
  - Creating and managing databases
  - Creating tables with `CREATE TABLE`
  - Data types in PostgreSQL (e.g., `INTEGER`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`)
  - Constraints (e.g., `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`)
- Tasks:
  - Create a database and tables.
  - Add constraints to your tables.
- Practice:
  - Create a sample database for a library or e-commerce system.

 Day 3: CRUD Operations
- Topics:
  - Inserting data with `INSERT`
  - Querying data with `SELECT`
  - Updating data with `UPDATE`
  - Deleting data with `DELETE`
- Tasks:
  - Perform CRUD operations on your tables.
  - Use `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` clauses.
- Practice:
  - Insert sample data into your tables and query it.

 Day 4: Advanced Querying
- Topics:
  - Filtering with `WHERE` and logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`)
  - Using `DISTINCT`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`
  - Aggregation functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`)
- Tasks:
  - Write queries to filter and aggregate data.
- Practice:
  - Analyze data from your sample database using aggregation.

 Day 5: Joins and Relationships
- Topics:
  - Understanding relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
  - Using `JOIN` (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN)
  - Self-joins and cross-joins
- Tasks:
  - Create related tables and practice joins.
- Practice:
  - Query data from multiple tables using joins.

 Day 6: Indexes and Performance
- Topics:
  - What are indexes and why are they important?
  - Creating and managing indexes
  - Understanding query execution plans with `EXPLAIN`
- Tasks:
  - Create indexes on your tables.
  - Analyze query performance using `EXPLAIN`.
- Practice:
  - Optimize queries using indexes.

 Day 7: Knowledge Test (Week 1)
- Test Topics:
  - Database and table creation
  - CRUD operations
  - Advanced querying
  - Joins and relationships
  - Indexes and performance
- Test Format:
  - 20 multiple-choice questions (2 marks each)
  - 5 short-answer questions (5 marks each)
  - 2 query-writing tasks (10 marks each)

- Topics:
  - What are transactions?
  - Using `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`
  - Understanding ACID properties
  - Concurrency control and isolation levels
- Tasks:
  - Perform transactions and handle errors.
- Practice:
  - Simulate concurrent transactions and observe behavior.

 Day 10: Stored Procedures and Functions
- Topics:
  - Creating stored procedures and functions
  - Using `PL/pgSQL` for procedural logic

  - Using triggers for data validation and automation
- Tasks:
  - Create triggers to automate tasks.
- Practice:
  - Use triggers to enforce business rules.

 Day 12: Backup and Recovery
